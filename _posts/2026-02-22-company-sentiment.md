# Summary
One of the most common discussions across developers seeking work is how they personally view those that they would work for. From our anecdotal personal experience, it seems to be a major component in the decision-making process.

These results are from us trying to measure that sentiment about companies on the platform. Any number of factors can be affect the sentiment, such as job security, median salary, work culture, and more. We did **not** measure what affected sentiment, but instead what the sentiment is measured as.

We also added optional questions at the end of the research surveys to get a better understanding of responses.

# Results
We first measured sentiment on a 1-10 scale for each major company on the platform, with 1 being "bad" and 10 being "good". We informed participants that a 5 indicates a neutral sentiment. In short, anything above a 5 score means the company is well-regarded, and anything below means there is something to learn from.

**Twin Atlas** scored highest on the tested companies, with their average sentiment score being 7.29. **Big Games** scored lowest, with an average score of 4.12.

Below is a list of all tested companies and their scores:
* Twin Atlas = 7.29
* Uplift Games = 6.53
* Quataun = 6.50
* Coffee Stain Studios = 6.00
* Voldex = 5.88
* Barrier Four = 5.88
* Tencell Studios = 5.73
* Sawhorse Interactive = 5.69
* Misfits = 5.67
* IX Studio = 5.60
* DoBig = 5.41
* Dubit = 5.25
* Boss Studio = 5.00
* Basket Entertainment = 4.57
* Super League = 4.56
* Indigo Studios = 4.44
* Gamefam = 4.18
* Big Games = 4.12

We also asked some open-ended questions.

### Do you have a most favorite company on Roblox?
Most commonly inputted for this was **Do Big**, with rationale being based on their ability to scale and give good acquisition offers. However, this response is inconsistent with the above data.

### Do you have a least favorite company on Roblox?
Like the data, the answer for this was **Big Games**. Their bad reputation seems to be caused by game design and monetization choices that participants felt was predatory.

### Do you think Roblox is great for indie developers, or is it built more for companies? Explain why.
On the surface, answers for this question were split down the middle. Some participants felt like companies have an advantage, while others felt like indie developers thrived on Roblox. That being said, many respones across both sides mention the aggressive algorithm made by Roblox, and how that can be used to grow a game.

# Final Notes
Take this data with a grain of salt, since the methodology is limiting. That being said, we feel this a great way to get a surface-level understanding on how people feel about various studios. If you have more questions about this data, please contact us.
